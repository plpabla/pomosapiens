# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — start dev server (Astro dev, Cloudflare workerd runtime via `@astrojs/cloudflare`)
- `npm run build` — production SSR build
- `npm run preview` — preview the production build locally
- `npm run lint` — ESLint with type-checked rules (`strictTypeChecked` + `stylisticTypeChecked` + React + Astro + a11y)
- `npm run lint:fix` — auto-fix lint issues
- `npm run format` — Prettier (includes `prettier-plugin-astro` + `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`)
- `npx supabase start` / `npx supabase stop` — local Supabase stack (Docker required)
- `npx wrangler deploy` — deploy to Cloudflare Workers

Pre-commit (`.husky/`) runs `lint-staged`: `eslint --fix` on `*.{ts,tsx,astro}`, `prettier --write` on `*.{json,css,md}`. Don't bypass with `--no-verify` — fix the underlying issue.

## Architecture

Astro 6 SSR app with React 19 islands, Tailwind 4, Supabase auth, and shadcn/ui components, deployed to Cloudflare Workers.

### Rendering mode

Full SSR (`output: "server"` in `astro.config.mjs`). All pages are server-rendered by default. **API routes (`src/pages/api/**`) must export `const prerender = false;`** — see `@src/pages/api/auth/signin.ts` for the pattern. Without it the Cloudflare adapter will try to prerender and fail at build.

### Auth flow

- `@src/lib/supabase.ts` — creates a Supabase SSR client (`@supabase/ssr`) with cookie-based sessions. Reads `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_KEY` from `astro:env/server` (server-only secrets declared in `astro.config.mjs` `env.schema`). Returns `null` when env is unconfigured; callers must handle that case.
- `@src/middleware.ts` — runs on every request. Resolves the current user via Supabase and attaches it to `context.locals.user`. Redirects unauthenticated requests for paths in the `PROTECTED_ROUTES` array. Add new protected paths there.
- API endpoints: `src/pages/api/auth/{signin,signup,signout}.ts`
- Auth pages: `src/pages/auth/{signin,signup,confirm-email}.astro`
- Example protected page: `src/pages/dashboard.astro`

### Key conventions

- **Path alias**: `@/*` → `./src/*` (tsconfig paths). Always use `@/` imports, not relative `../../`.
- **Astro vs React**: Astro components for static content/layout; React components only when interactivity is needed. No Next.js directives (`"use client"` etc.) — Astro decides hydration via `client:*` directives.
- **Tailwind class merging**: use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` (clsx + tailwind-merge) for conditional/merged class names. Don't concatenate class strings manually.
- **shadcn/ui**: components live in `src/components/ui/`, "new-york" style. Install new ones with `npx shadcn@latest add <name>`. Aliases defined in `components.json`.
- **API routes**: uppercase `GET` / `POST` exports; validate request bodies with zod schemas living in `src/lib/schemas/` (see `@src/lib/schemas/auth.ts`). Parse with the helper in `@src/lib/parse-request.ts`.
- **Supabase migrations**: `supabase/migrations/` using filename format `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_short_description.sql`. Always enable RLS on new tables with granular per-operation, per-role policies.
- **React Compiler is enabled** (`eslint-plugin-react-compiler` set to error). Don't add manual `useMemo` / `useCallback` micro-optimizations — the compiler handles them.

### Environment

- Node.js v22.14.0 (`.nvmrc`).
- `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_KEY` — copy `.env.example` → `.env` for Node tooling, and copy to `.dev.vars` for Cloudflare local dev. Both are gitignored.
- Local Supabase Studio: `http://localhost:54323` after `npx supabase start`. Project uses only the built-in `auth.users` table — no migrations required for auth.
- Production secrets: `npx wrangler secret put SUPABASE_URL` / `npx wrangler secret put SUPABASE_KEY`.

### CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs lint + build on push and PR to `master`. Requires `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_KEY` repository secrets for the build step (Astro `astro:env` validates them at build).

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit — Module 1, Lesson 2

Pick a starter and a stack for the PRD you wrote in Lesson 1, with the **stack chain**:

```
(/10x-init  →  /10x-shape  →  /10x-prd)  →  /10x-tech-stack-selector  →  (bootstrapper)
```

The PRD chain ships from Lesson 1 (re-included in this lesson so you can fix the PRD mid-flight). `/10x-tech-stack-selector` is the lesson's main topic; `/10x-bootstrapper` is the next link, taught in Lesson 3.

### Task Router — Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Stack selection (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-tech-stack-selector` | You have a PRD at `context/foundation/prd.md` and need to pick a starter. Opens with an explicit choice (take the recommended default for your `(product_type, language_family)` cell, or design your own), walks the follow-up question set when you design your own, applies four agent-friendly quality gates, reasons over the language-aware starter registry, and writes `context/foundation/tech-stack.md`. Optional `[path-to-prd]` argument lets you point at a non-default PRD location (e.g., `/10x-tech-stack-selector @context/foundation/prd-v2.md`); without it the skill defaults to `context/foundation/prd.md`. Use AFTER `/10x-prd`, BEFORE `/10x-bootstrapper`. |
| **Re-run upstream if needed** | |
| `/10x-init` / `/10x-shape` / `/10x-prd` | Bundled so you can fix the PRD mid-flight. If `/10x-tech-stack-selector` surfaces a gap (e.g., a Functional Requirement that forces a feature your recommended starter doesn't carry), re-run `/10x-prd` to amend the PRD before the stack pick. |

### How the chain hands off

- `/10x-tech-stack-selector` reads `context/foundation/prd.md` frontmatter (`product_type`, `target_scale`, `timeline_budget`) as priors. If the PRD is absent, it refuses with a one-sentence redirect to `/10x-shape` — no inline mini-PRD fallback.
- The skill writes `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` with a 4-key frontmatter (`starter_id`, `package_manager`, `project_name`, `hints`) plus a one-paragraph `## Why this stack` body. The hand-off is intentionally minimal — bootstrapper does not parse rationale, only fields.
- `/10x-bootstrapper` (Lesson 3) reads `tech-stack.md` and the registry to scaffold the project.

### What tech-stack-selector captures (and what it does NOT)

- **Captured**: starter pick (registry-shaped), language family, package manager (open string per ecosystem — `pnpm`, `uv`, `bundle`, `cargo`, etc.), team size, deployment target (drawn from the chosen starter's `deployment_defaults`), CI/CD provider + flow, bootstrapper confidence (`verified | first-class | best-effort`), path taken (standard | custom), self-check answers (custom path), quality override (set when the user proceeds with a starter that failed ≥1 agent-friendly gate), feature flags (auth/payments/realtime/AI/background-jobs).
- **NOT captured (deliberate)**: strategic test plan, strategic deployment plan, strategic implementation decisions. Those are downstream of stack selection — a future technical-roadmap concern, not yet planned. Tech-stack-selector owns *framework-shaped* test/deploy/CI choices because those are inseparable from stack pick; what defers is the *strategic* layer ("we TDD on X surface", "preview environment per PR").

### The opening choice (load-bearing)

The first question is an explicit choice — never silent. The skill names the recommended starter for your `(product_type, language_family)` cell up front and asks for explicit confirmation:

- **Standard path** — accept the recommended default. The skill skips the feature audit, team profile, tech preferences, and framework-variant questions; it asks only the deployment, CI/CD, and project-name questions. The hand-off records `path_taken: standard` under `hints`.
- **Custom path** — design your own. The skill walks the full follow-up set (feature audit, team profile, tech preferences, deployment, CI/CD, framework variant), drills into a testing-runner question only when the chosen starter leaves it ambiguous, and closes with a 5-point readiness self-check (from prework lesson 4.1) before locking in. The hand-off records `path_taken: custom` and populates `self_check_answers`.

The recommended-default-per-cell map is multi-language: web/JS and saas/JS both → 10x-astro-starter (the 10x-branded starter leads whenever it competes in a JS cell); api/JS → hono; api/Python → fastapi; web/Python → django; web/Ruby → rails; api/Go → go; api/Rust → axum; mobile/Dart → flutter; desktop/Rust → tauri; etc. Cells with no vetted default carry `<none>` and force the custom path.

### Quality gates (agent-friendly criteria)

Every starter card carries four booleans the LLM filters against:

1. **Typed** — explicit types/schemas the agent can reason from without running the program.
2. **Convention-based** — strong opinions on layout, routing, configuration.
3. **Popular in training data** — assessed *per language family*, not globally (Django is popular within Python training data; Spring within Java; etc.).
4. **Well-documented** — current, version-pinned, link-able docs.

Candidates failing any gate are excluded from the unprompted recommendation set. If you explicitly name a failing starter as your preference, the skill challenges that pick — surfacing the strongest higher-criteria alternative AND the compensation path (CLAUDE.md instructions that patch the gaps) — and asks you to confirm or pivot. Confirming the known-friction pick records the override on the hand-off so bootstrapper can adjust.

### Bootstrapper confidence

Every recommendation surfaces `bootstrapper_confidence` verbatim — never silently elided:

- **`verified`** — bootstrapper has been run end-to-end on this stack; scaffolding will be smooth.
- **`first-class`** — registered with a valid CLI, expected to work but not battle-tested; expect mostly-smooth scaffolding with occasional manual steps.
- **`best-effort`** — limited support; manual steps likely; expect friction (and bootstrapper's CLAUDE.md generation compensates with extra ecosystem-specific context).

This is the heads-up before running `/10x-bootstrapper` so you know what to expect.

### Foundation paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/prd.md` — input (from Lesson 1)
- `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` — output (the chain hand-off)
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` — recurring rules & pitfalls
- `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md` — load-bearing names registry

### Universal language

The shipped skill carries no 10xDevs / cohort / certification references. The recommended-default registry is multi-language (JS, Python, Ruby, Java, Go, Rust, PHP, .NET, Dart) and the cohort's `10x-astro-starter` is one card in the JS+web cell — not "the" recommended path for everyone.

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
